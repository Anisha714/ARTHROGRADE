# 🦴 ARTHROGRADE - Arthritis Grade Detection using Machine Learning

ARTHROGRADE is a machine learning-based project designed to assist in the **automated detection and grading of arthritis** from medical data or images (X-rays, MRI, etc.). This tool aims to support medical professionals in diagnosing arthritis more efficiently, consistently, and at an early stage.

## 💡 Project Objective
To build a reliable ML model that classifies the **severity of arthritis** (e.g., Grade 0 to Grade 4) using relevant features or medical imagery, thereby helping radiologists and orthopedic experts with a fast second opinion.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras (based on your code)
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
- OpenCV (if image processing is used)
